# Bank OCR Kata
## Description
This is just another Java implementation of the Bank OCR Kata. You can find the kata at the Coding Dojo of Emmanuel Gaillot.

I did implement all four user stories.
# Tests
* All the input files used here for testing of user stories 1, 3 and 4 were prepared by another project.
* I copied all the data from there.
